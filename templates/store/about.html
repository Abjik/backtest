                <h2>We are more expensive than the official manufacturers in South Korea.</h2>
                <p>This is because we ourselves buy from official retailers in South Korea with a small margin. We have
                    been working with them for many years, so we solve any issues directly through direct communication.

                <h2>And another very weighty argument in our favor!</h2>

                <p>When you buy from us, you can be 100% sure that the parcel will arrive safe and sound - for this you
                    paid us money and we will fulfill our obligations! But if you suddenly decide to save money, then
                    official retailers have such a fad when
                    ordering that if the package is lost during delivery by regular mail, they are not required to
                    refund the cost of the order. If the contents of the parcel were damaged, you will need to send the
                    parcel back to South Korea for examination
                    at your own expense (this is very expensive) and not the fact that you will be refunded.</p>

                <h2>We are more expensive than the joint venture (Joint purchases)</h2>
                <p>This is because we work officially and pay taxes. And most importantly, we are responsible for every
                    order we accept! If the joint venture loses your order, they may say "the post office is to blame
                    for everything", then we, as an official
                    store with a good reputation, are obliged to return the entire amount to you or resend the order. We
                    know cases when JVs with large orders simply stopped responding to messages or disappeared - real
                    cases of our clients. So you overpay
                    first of all for a guarantee.
